## 🧰 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python **3.10+**
- `git` (required to clone the repository)
- An API key for your chosen LLM provider (OpenAI, Gemini, or Anthropic)
- `Node.js` **18+** (optional - only required for browser interface)
- `conda` (optional - if not found, installer offers to auto-install Miniconda)

### Quick Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/CraftOS-dev/CraftBot.git
cd CraftBot

# Install dependencies
python install.py

# Run the agent
python run.py
```

That's it! The first run will guide you through setting up your API keys.

**Note:** If you don't have Node.js installed, the installer will guide you with step-by-step instructions. You can also skip browser mode and use TUI instead (see modes below).

### What you can do right after?
- Talk to the agent naturally
- Ask it to perform complex multi-step tasks
- Type `/help` to see available commands
- Connect to Google, Slack, Notion, and more

### 🖥️ Interface Modes

<div align="center">
    <img src="assets/WCA_README_banner.png" alt="CraftOS Banner" width="1280"/>
</div>

CraftBot supports multiple UI modes. Choose based on your preference:

| Mode | Command | Requirements | Best For |
|------|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Browser** | `python run.py` | Node.js 18+ | Modern web interface, easiest to use |
| **TUI** | `python run.py --tui` | None | Terminal UI, no dependencies needed |
| **CLI** | `python run.py --cli` | None | Command-line, lightweight |
| **GUI** | `python run.py --gui` | `install.py --gui` | Desktop automation with visual feedback |

**Browser mode** is the default and recommended. If you don't have Node.js, the installer will provide installation instructions or you can use **TUI mode** instead.

## 🖥️ GUI Mode (Optional)

GUI mode enables screen automation - the agent can see and interact with a desktop environment. This is optional and requires additional setup.

```bash
# Install with GUI support (using pip, no conda required)
python install.py --gui

# Install with GUI support and conda
python install.py --gui --conda

# Run with GUI mode
python run.py --gui
```

> [!NOTE]
> GUI mode is experimental and requires additional dependencies (~4GB for model weights). If you don't need desktop automation, skip this and use Browser/TUI mode instead which has no additional dependencies.

### 🔧 Background Service (Recommended)

Run CraftBot as a background service so it stays running even after you close the terminal. A desktop shortcut is created automatically so you can reopen the browser anytime.

```bash
# Install dependencies, register auto-start on login, and start CraftBot
python service.py install
```

That's it. The terminal closes itself, CraftBot runs in the background, and the browser opens automatically.

```bash
# Other service commands:
python service.py start    # Start CraftBot in background
python service.py status   # Check if it's running
python service.py stop     # Stop CraftBot
python service.py restart  # Restart CraftBot
python service.py logs     # See recent log output
```

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `python service.py install` | Install dependencies, register auto-start on login, start CraftBot, open browser, and close the terminal automatically |
| `python service.py start` | Start CraftBot in the background — auto-restarts if already running (terminal closes automatically) |
| `python service.py stop` | Stop CraftBot |
| `python service.py restart` | Stop and start CraftBot |
| `python service.py status` | Check if CraftBot is running and if auto-start is enabled |
| `python service.py logs` | Show recent log output (`-n 100` for more lines) |
| `python service.py uninstall` | Stop CraftBot, remove auto-start registration, uninstall pip packages, and purge pip cache |

> [!TIP]
> After `service.py start` or `service.py install`, a **CraftBot desktop shortcut** is created automatically. If you accidentally close the browser, just double-click the shortcut to reopen it.

> [!NOTE]
> **Installation:** The installer now provides clear guidance if dependencies are missing. If Node.js is not found, you'll be prompted to install it or can switch to TUI mode. Installation automatically detects GPU availability and falls back to CPU-only mode if needed.

> [!TIP]
> **First-time setup:** CraftBot will guide you through an onboarding sequence to configure API keys, the agent's name, MCPs, and Skills.

> [!NOTE]
> **Playwright Chromium:** Optional for WhatsApp Web integration. If installation fails, the agent will still work fine for other tasks. Install manually later with: `playwright install chromium`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting & Common Issues

### Missing Node.js (for Browser Mode)
If you see **"npm not found in PATH"** when running `python run.py`:
1. Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) (choose LTS version)
2. Install and restart your terminal
3. Run `python run.py` again

**Alternative:** Use TUI mode instead (no Node.js needed):
```bash
python run.py --tui
```

### Installation Fails with Dependencies
The installer now provides detailed error messages with solutions. If installation fails:
- **Check Python version:** Make sure you have Python 3.10+ (`python --version`)
- **Check internet:** Dependencies are downloaded during installation
- **Clear pip cache:** `pip install --upgrade pip` and try again

### Playwright Installation Issues
Playwright chromium installation is optional. If it fails:
- The agent will **still work fine** for other tasks
- You can skip it or install later: `playwright install chromium`
- Only needed for WhatsApp Web integration

### GPU/CUDA Issues
The installer automatically detects GPU availability:
- If CUDA installation fails, it falls back to CPU mode automatically
- For manual CPU setup: `python install.py --gui --cpu-only`

For detailed troubleshooting, see [INSTALLATION_FIX.md](INSTALLATION_FIX.md).

## 🐳 Run with Container

The repository root included a Docker configuration with Python 3.10, key system packages (including Tesseract for OCR), and all Python dependencies defined in `environment.yml`/`requirements.txt` so the agent can run consistently in isolated environments. 

Below are the setup instruction of running our agent with container.

### Build the image

From the repository root:

```bash
docker build -t craftbot .
```

### Run the container

The image is configured to launch the agent with `python -m app.main` by default. To run it interactively:

```bash
docker run --rm -it craftbot
```

If you need to supply environment variables, pass an env file (for example, based on `.env.example`):

```bash
docker run --rm -it --env-file .env craftbot
```

Mount any directories that should persist outside the container (such as data or cache folders) using `-v`, and adjust ports or additional flags as needed for your deployment. The container ships with system dependencies for OCR (`tesseract`), screen automation (`pyautogui`, `mss`, X11 utilities, and a virtual framebuffer), and common HTTP clients so the agent can work with files, network APIs, and GUI automation inside the container.

### Enabling GUI/screen automation

GUI actions (mouse/keyboard events, screenshots) require an X11 server. You can either attach to your host display or run headless with `xvfb`:

* Use the host display (requires Linux with X11):

  ```bash
  docker run --rm -it \
    -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
    -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
    -v $(pwd)/data:/app/app/data \
    craftbot
  ```

  Add extra `-v` mounts for any folders the agent should read/write.

* Run headlessly with a virtual display:

  ```bash
	docker run --rm -it --env-file .env craftbot bash -lc "Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1920x1080x24 & export DISPLAY=:99 && exec python -m app.main"
  ```

By default the image uses Python 3.10 and bundles the Python dependencies from `environment.yml`/`requirements.txt`, so `python -m app.main` works out of the box.
