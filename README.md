## 🧬 Living UI

**Living UI is a system/app/dashboard that evolve with your needs.**

Need a kanban board with an AI co-pilot built in? A custom CRM shaped exactly
like your workflow? A company dashboard that CraftBot can read and drive on
your behalf? Spin it up as a Living UI that runs alongside CraftBot and grows as your needs change.

<div align="center">
    <img src="assets/living-ui-example.png" alt="Living UI example" width="1280"/>
</div>

### Three ways to create a Living UI

1. **Build from scratch.** Describe what you want in plain language. CraftBot
   scaffolds the data model, backend API, and React UI, then iterates with
   you through a structured design process.

<div align="center">
    <img src="assets/living-ui-custom-build.png" alt="Building a Living UI from scratch" width="1280"/>
</div>

2. **Install from the marketplace.** Browse community-built Living UIs from [living-ui-marketplace](https://github.com/CraftOS-dev/living-ui-marketplace).

<div align="center">
    <img src="assets/living-ui-marketplace.png" alt="Living UI marketplace" width="1280"/>
</div>

3. **Import an existing project.** Point CraftBot at a Go, Node.js, Python,
   Rust, or static source code or github repo. It detects the runtime, configures health checks, and wraps it as a Living UI.

<div align="center">
    <img src="assets/living-ui-import.png" alt="Importing an existing project as a Living UI" width="1280"/>
</div>

### Keeps evolving

A Living UI is never "finished." Ask the agent to add features, redesign
a view, or hook it into new data as your needs grow.

### CraftBot inside the loop

CraftBot is embedded in every Living UI and **context-aware of its state**:
it can read the current DOM and form values, query app data through the
REST API, and trigger actions on your behalf.

## 🧰 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python **3.10+**
- `git` (required to clone the repository)
- An API key for your chosen LLM provider (OpenAI, Gemini, or Anthropic)
- `Node.js` **18+** (optional - only required for browser interface)
- `conda` (optional - if not found, installer offers to auto-install Miniconda)

### Quick Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/CraftOS-dev/CraftBot.git
cd CraftBot

# Install dependencies
python install.py

# Run the agent
python run.py
```

That's it! The first run will guide you through setting up your API keys.

**Note:** If you don't have Node.js installed, the installer will guide you with step-by-step instructions. You can also skip browser mode and use TUI instead (see modes below).

### What you can do right after?
- Talk to the agent naturally
- Ask it to perform complex multi-step tasks
- Type `/help` to see available commands
- Connect to Google, Slack, Notion, and more

### 🖥️ Interface Modes

<div align="center">
    <img src="assets/WCA_README_banner.png" alt="CraftOS Banner" width="1280"/>
</div>

CraftBot supports multiple UI modes. Choose based on your preference:

| Mode | Command | Requirements | Best For |
|------|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Browser** | `python run.py` | Node.js 18+ | Modern web interface, easiest to use |
| **TUI** | `python run.py --tui` | None | Terminal UI, no dependencies needed |
| **CLI** | `python run.py --cli` | None | Command-line, lightweight |

**Browser mode** is the default and recommended. If you don't have Node.js, the installer will provide installation instructions or you can use **TUI mode** instead.

python run.py --tui

# CLI mode (lightweight)
python run.py --cli

# With conda environment
conda run -n craftbot python run.py
```

### 🔧 Background Service (Recommended)

Run CraftBot as a background service so it stays running even after you close the terminal. A desktop shortcut is created automatically so you can reopen the browser anytime.

```bash
# Install dependencies, register auto-start on login, and start CraftBot
python service.py install
```

That's it. The terminal closes itself, CraftBot runs in the background, and the browser opens automatically.

```bash
# Other service commands:
python service.py start    # Start CraftBot in background
python service.py status   # Check if it's running
python service.py stop     # Stop CraftBot
python service.py restart  # Restart CraftBot
python service.py logs     # See recent log output
```

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `python service.py install` | Install dependencies, register auto-start on login, start CraftBot, open browser, and close the terminal automatically |
| `python service.py start` | Start CraftBot in the background — auto-restarts if already running (terminal closes automatically) |
| `python service.py stop` | Stop CraftBot |
| `python service.py restart` | Stop and start CraftBot |
| `python service.py status` | Check if CraftBot is running and if auto-start is enabled |
| `python service.py logs` | Show recent log output (`-n 100` for more lines) |
| `python service.py uninstall` | Stop CraftBot, remove auto-start registration, uninstall pip packages, and purge pip cache |

> [!TIP]
> After `service.py start` or `service.py install`, a **CraftBot desktop shortcut** is created automatically. If you accidentally close the browser, just double-click the shortcut to reopen it.

> [!NOTE]
> **Installation:** The installer now provides clear guidance if dependencies are missing. If Node.js is not found, you'll be prompted to install it or can switch to TUI mode. Installation automatically detects GPU availability and falls back to CPU-only mode if needed.

> [!TIP]
> **First-time setup:** CraftBot will guide you through an onboarding sequence to configure API keys, the agent's name, MCPs, and Skills.

> [!NOTE]
> **Playwright Chromium:** Optional for WhatsApp Web integration. If installation fails, the agent will still work fine for other tasks. Install manually later with: `playwright install chromium`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting & Common Issues

### Missing Node.js (for Browser Mode)
If you see **"npm not found in PATH"** when running `python run.py`:
1. Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) (choose LTS version)
2. Install and restart your terminal
3. Run `python run.py` again

**Alternative:** Use TUI mode instead (no Node.js needed):
```bash
python run.py --tui
```

### Installation Fails with Dependencies
The installer now provides detailed error messages with solutions. If installation fails:
- **Check Python version:** Make sure you have Python 3.10+ (`python --version`)
- **Check internet:** Dependencies are downloaded during installation
- **Clear pip cache:** `pip install --upgrade pip` and try again

### Playwright Installation Issues
Playwright chromium installation is optional. If it fails:
- The agent will **still work fine** for other tasks
- You can skip it or install later: `playwright install chromium`
- Only needed for WhatsApp Web integration

For detailed troubleshooting, see [INSTALLATION_FIX.md](INSTALLATION_FIX.md).

## 🐳 Run with Container

The repository root included a Docker configuration with Python 3.10, key system packages (including Tesseract for OCR), and all Python dependencies defined in `environment.yml`/`requirements.txt` so the agent can run consistently in isolated environments. 

Below are the setup instruction of running our agent with container.

### Build the image

From the repository root:

```bash
docker build -t craftbot .
```

### Run the container

The image is configured to launch the agent with `python -m app.main` by default. To run it interactively:

```bash
docker run --rm -it craftbot
```

If you need to supply environment variables, pass an env file (for example, based on `.env.example`):

```bash
docker run --rm -it --env-file .env craftbot
```

Mount any directories that should persist outside the container (such as data or cache folders) using `-v`, and adjust ports or additional flags as needed for your deployment. The container ships with system dependencies for OCR (`tesseract`) and common HTTP clients so the agent can work with files and network APIs inside the container.

By default the image uses Python 3.10 and bundles the Python dependencies from `environment.yml`/`requirements.txt`, so `python -m app.main` works out of the box.
