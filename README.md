## 🚀 Overview
<h3 align="center">
CraftBot is your Personal AI Assistant that lives inside your machine and works 24/7 for you. 
</h3>

It autonomously interprets tasks, plans actions, and executes them to achieve your goals.

Set up CraftBot on your machine or a separate environment. Interact with it via the TUI or from anywhere through your favorite messaging apps. Extend the agent's capabilities with MCPs and Skills, and connect to tools like Google Workspace, Slack, Notion, and Telegram to expand its reach. CraftBot intelligently switches between CLI mode for standard tasks and GUI mode when screen interaction is required (GUI mode runs in an isolated environment so it won't disturb your work).

CraftBot awaits your orders, set up your own CraftBot now.

## ✨ Features

- **CLI/GUI Mode** — Agent intelligently switches between CLI and GUI mode based on task complexity. GUI mode enables full desktop automation with screen capture, mouse/keyboard control, and window management.
- **Multi-LLM Support** — Flexible LLM provider system supporting OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, BytePlus, and local Ollama models. Easily switch between providers.
- **37+ Built-in Actions** — Comprehensive action library including:
  - **File Operations**: Find, read, write, grep, and convert files
  - **Web Capabilities**: HTTP requests, web search, PDF generation, image generation
  - **GUI Automation**: Mouse clicks, keyboard input, screenshots, window control
  - **Application Control**: Open apps, manage windows, clipboard operations
- **Persistent Memory** — RAG-based semantic memory system powered by ChromaDB. The agent remembers context across sessions with intelligent retrieval and incremental updates.
- **External tools integration** — Connect to Google Workspace, Slack, Notion, Zoom, LinkedIn, Discord, and Telegram (more to come!) with embedded credentials and OAuth support.
- **MCP** — Model Context Protocol integration for extending agent capabilities with external tools and services.
- **Skills** — Extensible skill framework with built-in skills for task planning, research, code review, git operations, and more.
- **Cross-Platform** — Full support for Windows and Linux with platform-specific code variants and Docker containerization.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Note for GUI mode:** The GUI mode is still in experimental phase. This means you may encounter issues when the agent switches to GUI mode. We are actively improving this feature.

## 🔜 Roadmap

- [X] **Memory Module** — Done.
- [ ] **External Tool integration** — Still adding more!
- [X] **MCP Layer** — Done.
- [X] **Skill Layer** — Done.
- [ ] **Proactive Behaviour** — Pending

---

## 🧰 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python **3.9+**
- `git`, `conda`, and `pip`
- An API key for your chosen LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI or Gemini)

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zfoong/CraftBot.git
cd CraftBot
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

Export your API key:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_KEY_HERE>
or
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=<YOUR_KEY_HERE>
```
Run:
```bash
python start.py
```

This executes the built-in **CraftBot**, that you can communicate to:
1. Talk to the agent  
2. Ask it to perform complex series of tasks  
3. Run command /help to seek help
4. Get along with the AI agent
5. Do advanced computer-use tasks with a dedicated but lightweight WebRTC Linux VM

### Terminal Arguments
| Argument | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `--only-cpu` | Run the agent on CPU mode |
| `--fast` | Skip unecessary update checks and launch agent faster. <br> <u><b>NOTE:</b></u> You have to run without `--fast` the first time you launch |
| `--no-omniparser` | Disable the use of microsoft omniparser to analyse UI - will greatly reduce GUI action accuracy. It is highly encouraged to use omniparser |
| `--no-conda` | Installs all packages globally instead of inside a conda environment |
| `--no-gui` | Disable GUI mode. The agent will run in CLI-only mode and cannot switch to GUI mode. This setting is persisted across restarts. OmniParser is also automatically disabled |
| `--enable-gui` | Re-enable GUI mode if it was previously disabled with `--no-gui`. This setting is persisted across restarts |

**EXAMPLE**
```bash
python start.py --only-cpu --fast
```

> [!HINT]
> **Onboarding:** Launching CraftBot for the first time will trigger an onboarding sequence where you set up API keys, the agent's name, MCPs, and Skills. Then, chatting with your CraftBot for the first time will prompt an interview session so it can update its USER.md and AGENT.md for future reference.

## Run with container

The repository root included a Docker configuration with Python 3.10, key system packages (including Tesseract for OCR), and all Python dependencies defined in `environment.yml`/`requirements.txt` so the agent can run consistently in isolated environments. 

Below are the setup instruction of running our agent with container.

### Build the image

From the repository root:

```bash
docker build -t craftbot .
```

### Run the container

The image is configured to launch the agent with `python -m core.main` by default. To run it interactively:

```bash
docker run --rm -it craftbot
```

If you need to supply environment variables, pass an env file (for example, based on `.env.example`):

```bash
docker run --rm -it --env-file .env craftbot
```

Mount any directories that should persist outside the container (such as data or cache folders) using `-v`, and adjust ports or additional flags as needed for your deployment. The container ships with system dependencies for OCR (`tesseract`), screen automation (`pyautogui`, `mss`, X11 utilities, and a virtual framebuffer), and common HTTP clients so the agent can work with files, network APIs, and GUI automation inside the container.

### Enabling GUI/screen automation

GUI actions (mouse/keyboard events, screenshots) require an X11 server. You can either attach to your host display or run headless with `xvfb`:

* Use the host display (requires Linux with X11):

  ```bash
  docker run --rm -it 
    -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
    -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
    -v $(pwd)/data:/app/core/data \
    craftbot
  ```

  Add extra `-v` mounts for any folders the agent should read/write.

* Run headlessly with a virtual display:

  ```bash
	docker run --rm -it --env-file .env craftbot bash -lc "Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1920x1080x24 & export DISPLAY=:99 && exec python -m core.main"
  ```

By default the image uses Python 3.10 and bundles the Python dependencies from `environment.yml`/`requirements.txt`, so `python -m core.main` works out of the box.
