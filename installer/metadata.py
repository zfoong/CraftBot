"""Install metadata read/write — a small JSON file recording where the
agent was installed and which run mode the user picked.

Written during the wizard's install flow, read by Repair (to know what to
overwrite), the wizard's state probe (to display Installed/Not installed),
and `cmd_start` (to know which agent EXE to spawn). Cleared by Uninstall.

Pure functions taking the metadata file path as an argument — keeps the
module decoupled from craftbot.py's path constants.
