[2026/02/17 03:19:02] [task_start]: Created task: 'User Profile Interview'
[2026/02/17 03:19:10] [agent reasoning]: I need to start the user profile interview by sending a warm greeting and asking for their preferred name. This is the first step in the ACKNOWLEDGE phase of the workflow. I should be conversational and friendly, explaining that I want to learn about them to provide better assistance.
[2026/02/17 03:19:10] [action_start]: Running action send_message with input: {'message': "Hi there! I'm excited to be your new AI assistant. To help me serve you better, I'd love to learn a bit about you. What would you like me to call you?", 'wait_for_user_reply': True}.
[2026/02/17 03:19:10] [action_end]: Action send_message completed with output: {'error': "Execution failed: local variable 'requirements' referenced before assignment"}.
[2026/02/17 03:19:17] [agent reasoning]: The send_message action failed due to an internal error. I need to try again with the same message to start the user profile interview. This is still the ACKNOWLEDGE phase where I'm introducing myself and asking for their preferred name.
[2026/02/17 03:19:17] [action_start]: Running action send_message with input: {'message': "Hi there! I'm excited to be your new AI assistant. To help me serve you better, I'd love to learn a bit about you. What would you like me to call you?", 'wait_for_user_reply': True}.
[2026/02/17 03:19:17] [action_end]: Action send_message completed with output: {'error': "Execution failed: local variable 'requirements' referenced before assignment"}.
[2026/02/17 03:19:33] [agent reasoning]: The send_message action is failing repeatedly due to an internal error. Since I need to communicate with the user to start the interview, I'll try a simpler approach and just send a basic greeting without the wait_for_user_reply parameter set to true initially.
[2026/02/17 03:19:33] [action_start]: Running action send_message with input: {'message': "Hi there! I'm excited to be your new AI assistant. To help me serve you better, I'd love to learn a bit about you. What would you like me to call you?", 'wait_for_user_reply': False}.
[2026/02/17 03:19:33] [action_end]: Action send_message completed with output: {'error': "Execution failed: local variable 'requirements' referenced before assignment"}.
[2026/02/17 04:42:00] [task_start]: Created task: 'User Profile Interview'
[2026/02/17 04:42:04] [user message]: agnet, how are you doing?
[2026/02/17 04:42:08] [agent reasoning]: I need to start the user profile interview task. Looking at the current state, I have a new task created for conducting a user profile interview. According to the workflow phases, I should start with the ACKNOWLEDGE phase by sending a warm greeting and asking what they'd like to be called. This is the first step in the interview process to gather information about the user.

[2026/02/17 04:42:22] [agent reasoning]: Great! The user responded with their name - Foong. Now I need to acknowledge their answer and move to the next question in the COLLECT phase. According to the interview flow, after learning their name, I should ask about what they do for work. I'll acknowledge their answer first, then ask about their job/role.
[2026/02/17 04:42:22] [action_start]: Running action send_message with input: {'message': 'Nice to meet you, Foong! What kind of work do you do?', 'wait_for_user_reply': True}.

[2026/02/17 04:42:39] [agent reasoning]: Excellent! Foong is an AI researcher who is developing me. This is very relevant information. Now I should acknowledge their answer and continue with the next identity question - asking about their location. This will help me understand their timezone and context better.
[2026/02/17 04:42:39] [action_start]: Running action send_message with input: {'message': "That's fascinating! You're developing me - so you're working on AI research. Where are you based?", 'wait_for_user_reply': True}.

[2026/02/17 04:42:54] [agent reasoning]: Great! Foong is based in Fukuoka, Japan. I can infer they're likely in Japan Standard Time (JST/UTC+9). Now I should move to the next phase of questions about communication preferences. I'll acknowledge their location and then ask about their preferred communication style.
[2026/02/17 04:42:54] [action_start]: Running action send_message with input: {'message': "Fukuoka - beautiful city! So you're in Japan Standard Time. How would you like me to communicate with you? Do you prefer casual and friendly, or more formal and professional? Brief responses or detailed explanations?", 'wait_for_user_reply': True}.
[2026/02/17 04:42:54] [agent message]: Fukuoka - beautiful city! So you're in Japan Standard Time. How would you like me to communicate with you? Do you prefer casual and friendly, or more formal and professional? Brief responses or detailed explanations?

[2026/02/17 04:42:54] [waiting_for_user]: Agent is waiting for user response.
[2026/02/17 04:43:08] [user message]: I live in Fukuoka but I am actually from Malaysia
[2026/02/17 04:43:15] [agent reasoning]: Interesting! Foong is from Malaysia but currently lives in Fukuoka. I should acknowledge this additional information and then continue with the communication preferences question that I asked, since they didn't answer that part yet.
[2026/02/17 04:43:15] [action_start]: Running action send_message with input: {'message': "Oh, Malaysian living in Fukuoka - that's a great combination of cultures! So, about communication style - do you prefer casual and friendly, or more formal and professional? Brief responses or detailed explanations?", 'wait_for_user_reply': True}.

[2026/02/17 04:43:25] [user message]: friendly is good
[2026/02/17 04:43:31] [agent reasoning]: Perfect! Foong prefers friendly communication. Now I should ask about proactivity level - whether they want me to be proactive with suggestions or wait for their instructions. This is the next important preference to understand for personalizing their experience.
[2026/02/17 04:43:31] [action_start]: Running action send_message with input: {'message': 'Friendly it is! Should I proactively suggest tasks and reminders, or would you prefer I wait for your instructions?', 'wait_for_user_reply': True}.

[2026/02/17 04:43:51] [agent reasoning]: Excellent! Foong wants me to be proactive. Now I need to ask about approval requirements - what types of actions they want me to ask approval for before doing. This is the final preference question before wrapping up the interview.
[2026/02/17 04:43:51] [action_start]: Running action send_message with input: {'message': 'Great! I love being proactive. For which types of actions should I ask your approval first?

[2026/02/17 04:44:08] [user message]: anythign that involve deleting something
[2026/02/17 04:44:15] [agent reasoning]: Perfect! Now I have gathered all the key information from Foong. They want me to ask approval for anything involving deletion. It's time to wrap up the interview by asking if there's anything else they'd like me to know, and then I'll move to the EXECUTE phase to update their profile.
[2026/02/17 04:44:15] [action_start]: Running action send_message with input: {'message': "Got it - I'll always ask before deleting anything. Is there anything else you'd like me to know about you or how you prefer to work?", 'wait_for_user_reply': True}.

[2026/02/17 04:46:31] [agent reasoning]: Great! Foong has indicated that's all the information they want to share. Now I need to move to the EXECUTE phase. I should read the current USER.md file first to understand the existing format, then update it with all the information I've gathered: name (Foong), job (AI researcher), location (Fukuoka, originally from Malaysia), timezone (Japan Standard Time), communication preferences (friendly), proactivity level (high), and approval requirements (deletion actions).
[2026/02/17 04:46:31] [action_start]: Running action read_file with input: {'file_path': 'C:/Users/zfoong/Desktop/agent/code/git/CraftBot/agent_file_system/USER.md'}.

[2026/02/17 04:46:48] [agent reasoning]: Perfect! I can see the USER.md format. Now I need to update it with all the information I gathered from Foong.

[2026/02/17 23:55:32] [agent reasoning]: The task is to list Python files in the core directory. Since this is a simple task, I need to find the core directory first and then list Python files within it. I'll start by exploring the file system to locate the core directory.
[2026/02/17 23:55:32] [action_start]: Running action find_files with input: {'pattern': 'core', 'recursive': True}.

[2026/02/18 00:15:36] [agent reasoning]: Current GUI screen displays a dark blue desktop background with two labeled icons on the left: a 'File System' disk icon (index 1) and a 'Home' folder icon (index 2). The top left corner features an 'Applications' button, and the top right system tray shows the timestamp '2025-02-18 00:14', a speaker icon, and the text 'abc'. Validation of past actions confirms the task 'Find cheapest flight Fukuoka to Tokyo' was successfully created, the acknowledgment message to Foong was sent and completed, and the switch to GUI mode was executed without errors. The Acknowledge phase of the todo workflow is fully completed, so the system needs to proceed to the next step of launching a web browser to access flight booking websites. The logical first action to locate a web browser is to open the applications menu via the 'Applications' button. This is the action I will execute: interact with the 'Applications' button to open the applications menu and find a web browser for accessing flight booking websites. The element involved has a position of [xmin_px, ymin_px, xmax_px, ymax_px] = [930, 0, 1064, 27]

Top left corner has an 'Applications' button (index 0) with a small blue indicator. Top right system tray shows timestamp '2025-02-18 00:15', speaker icon, and text 'abc'. Validation of past actions: Task was created successfully, acknowledgment message sent to Foong, GUI mode activated, and 3-second wait action completed without errors. The Acknowledge phase of the todo workflow is fully completed. To proceed with searching flight booking websites, a web browser is needed; since no browser icons are on the desktop, the next logical step is to open the Applications menu to locate a web browser. Decision: Interact with the 'Applications' button to access the menu and find a web browser. This is the action I will execute: click on the 'Applications' button to open the applications menu and locate a web browser. The element involved has a position of [xmin_px, ymin_px, xmax_px, ymax_px] = [930, 0, 1064, 27]

[2026/02/18 00:17:59] [agent reasoning]: Current screen details include a dark blue desktop background with two labeled icons on the left (index 1: "File System" disk icon, index 2: "Home" folder icon), an "Applications" button (index 0) with a small blue indicator in the top left corner, and a top right system tray featuring a speaker icon, a February 2026 calendar widget (highlighting the 18th), the timestamp "2026-02-18 00:16", and the text "abc". No applications menu is visible on the screen. Validation of past actions confirms the task creation, acknowledgment message send, GUI mode activation, 3-second wait, and mouse-click on the "Applications" button were all marked as successful, but the critical applications menu (needed to locate a web browser for the flight search) is not present. This suggests the previous click may not have fully triggered the menu to open, possibly due to a system delay or unregistered interaction. To proceed with accessing a web browser for the flight booking website search, the next logical decision is to re-interact with the "Applications" button to ensure the menu opens, allowing us to browse available applications and select a web browser. This is the action I will execute: left-click on the "Applications" button to open the applications menu and locate a web browser. The element involved has a position of [xmin_px, ymin_px, xmax_px, ymax_px] = [20, 7, 97, 22]

Top right system tray features a speaker icon, timestamp '2026-02-18 00:18', and text 'abc'. No Applications menu is visible on the screen. Validation of past actions confirms task creation, acknowledgment message send, GUI mode activation, 3-second wait, and two left-clicks on the 'Applications' button were marked as successful, but the critical Applications menu (required to locate a web browser for the Fukuoka-Tokyo flight search) remains unavailable. This indicates the previous clicks did not fully trigger the menu to open, likely due to system delay or unregistered interaction. To proceed with accessing a web browser for flight booking website navigation, the next logical step is to re-interact with the 'Applications' button to ensure the menu opens, allowing selection of a web browser. This is the action I will execute: left-click on the 'Applications' label to open the applications menu and locate a web browser. The element involved has a position of [xmin_px, ymin_px, xmax_px, ymax_px] = [10, 40, 89, 59]

[2026/02/18 00:19:22] [agent reasoning]: Current screen details: Dark blue desktop background with three vertically stacked elements on the left, all enclosed in blue selection outlines. The top element is the 'Applications' label (index 0), followed by the 'File System' disk icon (index 1) and 'Home' folder icon (index 2). The top right system tray contains a speaker icon, the timestamp '2026-02-18 00:18', and the text 'abc'. No applications menu is visible on the screen. Validation of past actions confirms all prior steps (task creation, acknowledgment message send, GUI mode activation, 3-second wait, three sequential left-clicks on the Applications button/label) were marked as successful, but the critical applications menu (required to locate a web browser for the Fukuoka-Tokyo flight search) remains unavailable. This discrepancy indicates the previous interactions did not properly trigger the menu to open, potentially due to misaligned click positions or temporary system unresponsiveness. To proceed with accessing a web browser for flight booking website navigation, the next logical decision is to re-left-click on the 'Applications' label to attempt opening the applications menu again. This is the action I will execute: left-click on the 'Applications' label to open the applications menu and locate a web browser for flight booking website access. The element involved has a position of [xmin_px, ymin_px, xmax_px, ymax_px] = [930, 0, 1064, 27]

[2026/02/18 00:20:28] [agent reasoning]: Current screen details: Dark blue desktop background with three vertically stacked elements on the left, all enclosed in blue selection outlines. The top element is the 'Applications' label (index 0), followed by the 'File System' disk icon (index 1) and 'Home' folder icon (index 2). The top right system tray contains a speaker icon, the timestamp '2026-02-18 00:19', the text 'abc', and a calendar widget showing Wednesday 18 February 2026. No applications menu is visible on the screen. Validation confirms that the Acknowledge phase of the todo workflow has been successfully completed (the acknowledgment message was sent to Foong), so the corresponding todo should be marked as completed. Past actions include four sequential click attempts (single and double clicks on different positions of the 'Applications' button/label) that were marked as successful but failed to open the critical applications menu required to locate a web browser for the Fukuoka-Tokyo flight search. This indicates that repeated standard click interactions are not triggering the menu to open, so an alternative right-click interaction on the 'Applications' label is proposed to potentially trigger the applications menu to open, allowing access to a web browser for the flight booking website search. This is the action I will execute: right-click on the 'Applications' label to open the applications menu and locate a web browser for flight booking website access. The element involved has a position of [xmin_px, ymin_px, xmax_px, ymax_px] = [858, 28, 1064, 66]

No main Applications menu (for locating a web browser) is visible beyond this context menu. Validation confirms the Acknowledge phase of the todo workflow is fully completed (the acknowledgment message was successfully sent to Foong), so the corresponding 'Acknowledge:' todo should be marked as completed. Past actions included repeated click attempts that failed to open the main Applications menu until a recent right-click triggered this context menu; the 'Applications' option at the bottom of this context menu is the likely entry point to the main applications list needed to find a web browser for the Fukuoka-Tokyo flight search. The decision is to first mark the Acknowledge todo as completed, then left-click on the 'Applications' option in the open context menu to access the main applications list and locate a web browser. This is the action I will execute: mark 'Acknowledge: Send task receipt acknowledgment to user' as completed, then left-click on the 'Applications' option in the open top-right context menu to open the main applications list.
