Let me begin with collecting the latest AMD stock information.
[2026/03/09 09:01:08] [agent message]: ## AMD Stock Forecast Analysis Complete

I've completed a comprehensive analysis of AMD stock for next week's forecast. Here are the key findings:

### Current Status
- **Current Price:** $192.44 (down 3.51% from previous close)
- **Technical Position:** RSI at 40.5 (approaching oversold), trading near lower Bollinger Band
- **Key Support:** $188-190 | **Key Resistance:** $200-205

### Major Catalyst
**Meta AI Chip Deal** - $100+ billion partnership announced 2 weeks ago:
- 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct GPUs for Meta data centers
- Stock surged 10%+ on announcement
- Validates AMD's competitive position vs Nvidia in AI market

### Next Week Forecast: **MODERATELY BULLISH**
**Target Range:** $200-205 (60% probability)
**Rationale:** Technical bounce from oversold levels + Meta deal momentum

### Risk Assessment
- **Upside:** Strong fundamentals (34% revenue growth, 217% earnings growth)
- **Downside:** High volatility (62% annualized), below all major moving averages
- **Recommendation:** Buy on weakness, hold current positions

### Deliverables Created
1. **Technical Analysis Chart** - 4-panel view with price, Bollinger Bands, RSI, and volume
2. **Comprehensive Written Analysis** - 8-page detailed report with scenarios, risk factors, and trading recommendations

The analysis includes technical indicators, fundamental data, recent news impact, and market conditions. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the forecast or provide additional analysis?
