# Living UI Importer

Import any external app into CraftBot's Living UI system. The app gets lifecycle management (start/stop/restart), health monitoring, logging, and agent observation.

## Workflow

1. **Detect** — Analyze the app source to determine runtime, build, and start commands
2. **Configure** — Generate the launch configuration
3. **Import** — Call `living_ui_import_external` to register the project
4. **Launch** — Call `living_ui_notify_ready` or let the user launch from the UI
5. **Document** — Create LIVING_UI.md describing the app

## Step 1: Detect App Type

Read the root directory of the app and identify the runtime by checking for these files.

**IMPORTANT: Always prefer native builds over Docker.** Docker adds complexity (daemon dependency, container lifecycle, port mapping, line endings). Only use Docker as a last resort when no native toolchain is available.

**Priority order** (check top to bottom, use the FIRST match):

| File Found | Runtime | Install Command | Start Command |
|---|---|---|---|
| `go.mod` | go | `go build -o app .` | `./app` |
| `package.json` | node | `npm install` | Read `scripts.start` from package.json |
| `requirements.txt` + `manage.py` | python (Django) | `pip install -r requirements.txt` | `python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:{{PORT}}` |
| `requirements.txt` + `app.py` or `main.py` | python (Flask/FastAPI) | `pip install -r requirements.txt` | `python app.py` or `uvicorn main:app --port {{PORT}}` |
| `Cargo.toml` | rust | `cargo build --release` | Read binary name from Cargo.toml, run `./target/release/{name}` |
| `index.html` (no package.json) | static | none | `python -m http.server {{PORT}}` |
| `Dockerfile` only (no source files) | docker | `docker build -t {name} .` | `docker run -p {{PORT}}:{internal_port} {name}` |

**If the app has BOTH a Dockerfile AND source files (go.mod, package.json, etc.):**
- ALWAYS build natively using the source files
- IGNORE the Dockerfile — it's just for deployment, not for local dev
- Check if the required toolchain is installed first (e.g., `go version`, `node --version`)
- If the toolchain is NOT installed, inform the user and ask them to install it — do NOT fall back to Docker

Also read:
- **README.md** — for build/run instructions the user wrote
- **Dockerfile** — for the internal port (`EXPOSE` directive) — useful even when not using Docker
- **Makefile** — for build targets
- **.env.example** — for required environment variables

## Step 2: Determine Port Configuration

External apps handle ports differently:

1. **Environment variable** — Most apps respect `PORT=3108`. Set `port_env_var: "PORT"`
2. **Command-line flag** — Some apps use `--port 3108`. Use `{{PORT}}` in the start command
3. **Config file** — Some apps read from a config file. Modify the config file to use the allocated port
4. **Hardcoded** — Worst case. Find and replace the port number in the source

Check in this order:
1. Does the README mention a PORT environment variable?
2. Does the Dockerfile use `ENV PORT` or `EXPOSE`?
3. Does the start script accept a `--port` flag?
4. Is there a config file (YAML, JSON, TOML) with a port setting?

## Step 3: Determine Health Check

| App Type | Health Strategy | Config |
|---|---|---|
| Has `/health` or `/healthz` endpoint | `http_get` | `url: "http://localhost:{{PORT}}/health"` |
| Web app with no health endpoint | `http_get` | `url: "http://localhost:{{PORT}}"` (root page) |
| Non-web app (background service) | `process_alive` | Just check if process is running |
| TCP service | `tcp` | Check if port is listening |

## Step 4: Call the Import Action

```
living_ui_import_external(
    name="Glance Dashboard",
    description="Self-hosted dashboard for monitoring feeds, weather, and more",
    source_path="/absolute/path/to/app/source",
    app_runtime="go",
    install_command="go build -o glance .",
    start_command="./glance --port {{PORT}}",
    health_strategy="http_get",
    health_url="http://localhost:{{PORT}}",
    port_env_var="",
)
```

## Step 5: Create LIVING_UI.md

After importing, create a `LIVING_UI.md` in the project directory documenting:
- What the app does
- How to configure it
- Key files and their purpose
- API endpoints (if any)
- Configuration file format

## Examples

### Node.js Express App
```
App detected: Node.js (package.json found)
Install: npm install
Start: npm start (from package.json scripts.start)
Port: PORT env var (common for Express)
Health: http_get on http://localhost:{{PORT}}
```

### Go Binary (Glance)
```
App detected: Go (go.mod found)
Install: go build -o glance .
Start: ./glance
Port: --port flag or config file
Health: http_get on http://localhost:{{PORT}}
```

### Static HTML Site
```
App detected: Static (index.html, no package.json)
Install: (none)
Start: python -m http.server {{PORT}}
Port: command-line argument
Health: http_get on http://localhost:{{PORT}}
```

### Docker App
```
App detected: Docker (Dockerfile found)
Install: docker build -t myapp .
Start: docker run --rm -p {{PORT}}:8080 myapp
Port: mapped via -p flag
Health: http_get on http://localhost:{{PORT}}
```

## FORBIDDEN

- NEVER use Docker to build or run an app if native source files exist (go.mod, package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml). Build natively instead.
- NEVER ask the user to install Docker. If the native toolchain (Go, Node, Python, Rust) isn't installed, ask the user to install THAT instead.
- NEVER modify the original app source code during import (that's for the modify skill later)
- NEVER skip reading the README — it often has the correct build/run instructions
- NEVER assume a port — always detect it from the app's configuration
- NEVER use `living_ui_notify_ready` for external apps — use `living_ui_import_external` instead
