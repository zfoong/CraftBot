"""Host-side routing: which integration actions to expose to the agent's
conversation-mode loop, given which integrations currently have credentials.

This is a host concern — the package (``craftos_integrations``) only tells us
which platforms are connected. The choice of which @action-decorated function
names to surface for each platform is curation that lives here, alongside the
action files themselves.

If you add a new integration with new conversation-mode actions, add the
mapping below.
