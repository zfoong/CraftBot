"""Runtime compatibility shims for environments where asyncio task context
gets lost or never registered.

Specifically: on some Python 3.14 conda-forge builds inside this host,
``asyncio.current_task()`` returns ``None`` even inside a coroutine started
via ``asyncio.create_task()``. That breaks any third-party library that uses
``asyncio.timeout(...)`` (websockets, aiohttp, etc.) because
``Timeout.__aenter__`` raises ``RuntimeError("Timeout should be used inside
a task")`` when ``current_task()`` is ``None``.

This shim relaxes that check: if ``current_task()`` is ``None``, the
timeout context simply runs without arming a deadline. When a task IS
detected, the original behavior is preserved.

The shim is idempotent and applied once at package import.
