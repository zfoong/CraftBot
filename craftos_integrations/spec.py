"""IntegrationSpec — shared metadata held by both handler and client.

Each integration declares one IntegrationSpec instance (frozen dataclass)
and assigns it as a class attribute on its handler and client. This is
composition: there is no shared base class for "Slack-the-thing", just
two collaborators referencing the same metadata.
