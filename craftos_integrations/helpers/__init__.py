"""Internal helpers for integration authors.

These are package-internal utilities used by integration files
(``craftos_integrations/integrations/<name>.py``). They're not part of the
public consumer API — host applications interact with the package via the
top-level facade (``configure``, ``initialize_manager``, ``get_handler``, etc.).

Submodules:
    http: thin wrappers around httpx that handle the standard REST
          ``status_code → {ok, result} | {error, details}`` envelope shape.
    result: ``Result`` / ``Ok`` / ``Err`` TypedDict aliases for the envelope —
            use as return annotations for static type-checking benefits.
